# VAST-challenge-2018-Mini-Challenge-2
## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of a dataset provided as part of the VAST Challenge 2018 Mini Challenge 2. The focus of this investigation is to explore possible links between water sensor readings and the population decline of the Rose Crested Blue Pipit, a locally cherished bird species.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises several years of water sensor readings from rivers and streams in the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve. These readings include measurements of various chemicals of interest. You can download the dataset from the VAST Challenge 2018 MC2 website.

## Background
Mistford, a mid-size city located southwest of the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve, has recently faced concerns regarding the declining population of the Rose Crested Blue Pipit. Previous investigations, such as the VAST Challenge 2017, hinted at a possible link between the bird's decline and activities at Kasios Office Furniture, a local manufacturing firm. Despite lacking conclusive evidence, further visual analytics investigation is deemed necessary.

## Analysis Questions
1. Describe trends and anomalies with respect to chemical contamination
Trends: Identify changes over time and/or sensor site.
Anomalies: Detect sudden changes over time or significant deviations at specific sites.
2. Describe any data quality and uncertain issues
Identify issues such as missing data, changes in collection frequency, and unrealistic values.
